# Financial_Inclusion_Marketing_Campaign-
Design an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and SQL for a financial institution's marketing campaign data. The goal is to process raw customer, campaign, and transaction data to create a clean, integrated dataset for analytics. 

Summary 
• Overall campaign response rate is low, with most customers not engaging. 
• Medium-income customers in semi-urban and rural regions show the highest potential for positive response. 
• Urban and low-income customer segments need tailored strategies, focusing on personalization and digital engagement. 
• Campaign timing should align with natural transaction peaks (e.g., salary cycles, seasonal events) to improve effectiveness.
